/**
 * Live updates.
 *
 * One WebSocket per open screen, subscribed to one topic. There are two kinds:
 *
 * - A session socket, subscribed to a topic named after the session. Any change
 *   republishes the whole session snapshot to that topic, so a game master adding
 *   an NPC, dragging the initiative order, or moving the turn marker lands on
 *   every player's screen without a refresh.
 * - A library socket, subscribed to a topic named after the game master, carrying
 *   the list of their sessions. Starting or ending a session republishes that list,
 *   so a library open in another tab follows along instead of showing a session
 *   that finished ten minutes ago.
 *
 * Authentication happens at upgrade time, from the same cookies the REST API
 * uses. An unauthenticated upgrade is refused outright — there is no anonymous
 * read of a session.
