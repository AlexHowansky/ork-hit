/**
 * Every line the log can carry.
 *
 * One module rather than a string at each call site, for two reasons.
 *
 * The first is that the log has a voice, and a voice is only consistent if it is
 * in one place to be read. These are the sentences a table will scroll back
 * through at midnight trying to work out when somebody went; they should sound
 * like they were written together, because they were.
 *
 * The second is circular imports. The events are written from three modules —
 * the session routes, the auth routes, and the socket's own grace-period
 * removal — and `ws.ts` cannot import from `routes/sessions.ts`, which already
 * imports from `ws.ts`. Somewhere neutral is the only place all three can reach.
 *
 * Builders rather than templates at the call site, so a test asserts on the same
 * string the server writes rather than on a copy of it that can drift.
 *
 * Two rules hold the wording together. Every line is in the past tense and names
 * the person, because a log line is read long after the moment it describes:
 * `Ada joined` still makes sense an hour later, where "joined" on its own does
 * not. And **whoever acted is the subject of the sentence** — the players' own
 * doings in their names, the game master's in theirs — so that reading back
 * through a night tells you not only what the table came to be, but who made it
 * so. The routes can always tell: a player's claim and the game master's
 * assignment are separate endpoints behind separate authorisations.
 *
 * The clock is the one exception, and it is at the bottom with its reasons.

 * they did not set appeared. The condition itself is marked with `markTag` like
 * every other line about one, so the log draws it as the pill on the character's
 * row rather than as a word that happens to name it.
