/**
 * A game master's own settings.
 *
 * What is here is about the person rather than about the table: how big they
 * want cards drawn, and whatever else joins it later. It hangs off the `gms` row
 * so that it follows them to whichever machine they sign in on — the theme,
 * which is about the room they are sitting in rather than about them, stays in
 * the browser instead (`client/theme.ts`).
 *
 * There is no GET. The one caller is the console at boot, and it already asks
 * who it is talking to — `/api/auth/me` carries the settings back with the
 * identity, which saves a second round trip before the first card is drawn.
