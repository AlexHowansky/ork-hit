/**
 * Authorised delivery of uploaded files.
 *
 * Uploads live outside any statically served directory, so the only way to reach
 * one is through these handlers — which means every request is authenticated and
 * authorised first.
 *
 * Character sheets are the sensitive case: they carry the game master's own
 * JavaScript. They are served with a `sandbox` Content-Security-Policy, which
 * puts the document in an *opaque origin*. It is same-site by URL, but the
 * browser treats it as its own origin with no relationship to the app: it cannot
 * read `document.cookie`, touch `localStorage`, reach into the parent frame, or
 * call the API as the signed-in user. The embedding iframe repeats the sandbox
 * as an attribute, so the restriction holds even if the frame is reached some
 * other way.
