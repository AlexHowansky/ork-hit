/**
 * Colour theme preference.
 *
 * Three states: follow the system, force light, force dark. "System" is the
 * default and is handled entirely in CSS, so a reader who never touches the
 * toggle gets a correct first paint with no script involved. An explicit choice
 * is written to <html data-theme> and remembered in localStorage.
 *
 * What is stored is the preference — "light" or "dark" — and what is written to
 * the attribute is the daisyUI theme that realises it. The two are kept apart
 * deliberately: `THEMES` is the only place in the app that knows which stock
 * themes we have chosen, so swapping `winter` for another light theme is a
 * one-line change that leaves every reader's stored preference intact.
