/**
 * The player's view of a session.

 * live — a character the game master adds or removes, a reorder, or a change of
 * turn all arrive over the socket without a refresh.
 *
 * A player who hasn't picked a character yet is asked to choose one first.
 *
 * When the turn reaches this player's character they get a toast and a chime,
 * since a table is a room full of distractions and the highlighted row alone is
