  /**
   * Files sheets dropped on the character panel as characters, there and then.
   *
   * Everything the add dialog would have asked for is already known: the panel
   * only exists while a campaign is selected, the file names the character the
   * way the dialog's own name field would have, and a dropped character is an NPC
   * until it is edited — the same default the dialog offers, and for the same
   * reason: a folder of sheets dropped on a campaign is a folder of monsters far
   * more often than it is a party. So the dialog would have been a form with nothing left
   * to fill in, and a folder of sheets can be filed by dropping the folder.
   *
   * A name the campaign already has is that character being *updated*, not a
   * collision. Re-exporting from HERO Designer and dropping the file back is how
   * a sheet is kept current, and the alternative was finding each character,
   * opening its dialog and picking the file by hand. So the file replaces the
   * stored sheet, the characteristics inside it replace the character's, and the
   * portrait inside it replaces the picture — the dropped file is the whole of
   * the intent, and there is nothing in the gesture that could mean "but keep the
   * old picture". What it leaves alone is the kind: a monster dropped over a hero
   * does not make that hero a monster, and the dialog is where that is decided.
   *
   * Matched on the name the way the server matches it — its `COLLATE NOCASE`
   * against `sensitivity: "base"` here, the same stand-in `insertByName` uses.
   * The list is this page's own, so a character added in another tab since it
   * loaded is not in it; that file takes the create path and gets the conflict it
   * always did, which a reload puts right.
   *
   * Every dropped file is handled one request at a time — the server takes a
   * portrait out of each sheet, and a dozen of those at once is a dozen image
   * decodes racing each other for no gain. Each character appears as it lands,
   * in name order, so the panel fills in as the batch goes. One failure is
   * reported and the rest carry on.
