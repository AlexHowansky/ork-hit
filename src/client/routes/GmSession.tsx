        width of it — it is the same fight — so the two travel together as one
        column wherever they land.

        Where they land is the fight in the middle of the dashboard, with the
        library on one side of it and the players on the other: the library feeds
        the stage, the stage is what the evening is about, and a game master
        reading left to right meets the three in the order they are used. At `sm`
        there is no middle to be in, so the fight takes the right-hand half and
        everything about the table — the code, who has joined, and what there is
        to bring on — stacks up on the left. Stacked on a phone the code comes
        first, because a session's first minute is reading it out.

        The wrappers are `display: contents` until their column exists, so the
        panels are items of one flow while stacked, and `order` alone says where
        each lands on each layout rather than a second copy of the markup saying
        so.

        Nothing here grows: every panel is a flex item at its natural height, so
        a short list ends where its content does. `scroll` on the lists is the
        guard for the other direction — a list taller than the fixed wide frame
        shrinks back and scrolls its own body instead of being clipped by it.
