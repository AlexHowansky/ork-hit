/**
 * The game master's settings that are not a matter of CSS.
 *
 * `cardSize.ts` is the other half of this: a setting whose whole effect is a
 * custom property on the document, which nothing needs to re-render for. What is
 * here changes what the console *shows*, so React has to hear about it — hence a
 * store rather than a style.
 *
 * A module-level store rather than a context, for the same reason the card size
 * is one: the settings drawer and the screens that obey the settings are nowhere
 * near each other in the tree, and threading a value through two page components
 * that have no interest in it is a worse trade than a store with two callers.
 *
 * The server is where these live. This holds what it last told us — set from the
 * identity at boot (`app.tsx`) and again by the drawer as a reader changes it —
 * and holds nothing at all for a player, who has no account to keep a setting on.
