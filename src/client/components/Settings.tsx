 * the top left because its control is in that corner; these come out of the top
 * right because theirs is, and a reader who has just pressed the gear should
 * find the panel under their finger rather than across the page.
 *
 * What is in it belongs to the game master rather than to the table, and is kept
 * on their row in the database so that it follows them to whichever machine they
 * sign in on. The drawer is on the game master's screens only for that reason: a
 * player has no account to keep a setting against.
