 * The segment panel: everybody on the stage, in the order they act.

 * keeps the two screens honestly in agreement about what the order is.
 *
 * The two rows are not identical under the name, though, and `editable` is what
 * decides: the game master's carries the four looked-up characteristics, since
 * this is where the order is worked out and those are what it is worked out
 * from, and a player's carries who is playing what, which is what their scene is
 * asked for. Neither is missing the other for want of room.
 *
 * Nothing here decides the order. It arrives already sorted — SPD says which
 * segments a character acts in, DEX+INIT says who goes first inside one — and
 * this only draws it, dimming the characters who have no phase in the segment
 * the fight is on, or hiding them outright when the reader asks for that.
